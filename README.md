### Description
This assignment contains the base LinkedStack.h code, Validator.h, and 
Launcher.h classes that form the console program to add big integer 
numbers together. The number calcaulations store individual numbers in
a LinkedStack. It is processed by a method in validator that also 
ensures that inputs are valid. LinkedStacks are then popped 
simultaneously and added together to yield a calculated integer. The 
integer is then modulated and all tens places are moved as if adding 
integers by hand and will yield the answer as a string.
