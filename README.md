### Description
This assignment contains the base LinkedStack.h code to formulate a LinkedStack 
for any object type. It is a LinkedList that behaves as if it was a Stack. A 
main.cpp class is included to demonstrate testing of the LinkedStack class. Just
uncomment the method to use it. This version of LinkedStack will be used in the 
next two parts of the assignment.
